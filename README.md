## PROJECT TITLE: BASICS OF DATA ANALYSIS
---
### PROJECT OVERVIEW: This documentation takes you through the basic knowledge to be acquired to be an entry level data analyst. It focuses on explaining the key functions used needed to achieve basic goals in datat analysis such as data clean up, creation and visualisation and proper story telling or report. 
### WHAT IS DATA ANALYSIS?
- Data analysis involes the inspecting, cleanind, transformation and modelling data to discover new info, draw cocclusions and support decision making.
### DATA SOURCES
- Open source data
- Keggle
- nigerian bewries
- bshop enterprises
### DATA FORMS
- Structured data (Data in tabular form like spreadsheet or database)
- Semi structured data (XML and JSON files)
- Unstructured data ( No predefined format e.g media files, email)
### TOOLS USED
- Microsoft Excel - (Data entry, data cleanup and analysis)
- SQL- Standard Query Language (Data entry, data management and retrieval)
- Power bi- (Data visualisation and report)
- Github - (Data analyst Portfolio building)

### DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION: After the entry or collection of data from whatever source, the first step in analysis is the cleanup of the data. This may involve the use of various functions in excel and SQL 
#### EXCEL FUNCTIONS FOR DATA CLEAN UP AND PREPARATION
- TRIM: Removes extra spaces from text, leaving only single spaces between words
- CLEAN: Removes non-printable characters from text
- LEFT, RIGHT, MID: Extracts parts of text from a cell (left, right, or middle).
- IF: Creates conditional logic to clean or categorize data.
E.G, =IF(A1>=50, "Pass", "Fail")
If A1 = 60, the formula returns "Pass".
If A1 = 45, the formula returns "Fail".

#### SQL QUERIES FOR DATA CLEAN UP AND PREPARATION 
- TRIM; Removes leading and trailing spaces from a string.
Example: SELECT TRIM(' Example '); returns 'Example'
- UPPER/LOWER; Converts text to uppercase or lowercase.
Example: SELECT UPPER('hello'); returns 'HELLO'.
Example: SELECT LOWER('HELLO'); returns 'hello'
- CASE WHEN; A conditional statement for handling different scenarios or values.
Example: SELECT CASE WHEN column = 'A' THEN 'Group 1' ELSE 'Group 2' END FROM table

### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS : Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of investigating and summarizing datasets to discover patterns, trends, relationships, and anomalies, often before applying more complex statistical models. EDA involves both graphical and statistical techniques, helping analysts understand the data's underlying structure, spot errors, and gain insights that inform decision-making and further analysis.  
#### the use of Pivot Tables in Excel is an essential part of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Pivot tables help to quickly summarize, analyze, and explore large datasets by organizing and aggregating data in a flexible way, which is key to understanding trends, relationships, and patterns in the data.
